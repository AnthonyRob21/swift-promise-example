<p>I'm building an iOS app and Android app that shares core logic through a Silver Shared Project written in Swift.</p>

<p>This project originally was intended to port a Promise/Future programming style to Swift, but now is evolved through the amazing RemObjects Fire IDE project pretty much like a shared library to build cross platforms core logic libraries (Http, I/O, File System, Database).</p>

<p>You can find in the repo:</p>

<p>A Shared Project in Silver / Swift code (2.1 supported on latest Fire Beta 8.3.92)
A iOS target, to build a static ARMv7/ARM64 library
A Android target to build Android-19 jars.
A (Xcode project) iOS Sample app (CrossTest). This is intended like a playground for Swift code and ObjC bridging as well as the iOS app that shares the static library;
A Android Sample app (AndroidStudio project), to test the shared jar libraries build in Swift.
I would like to share this solution since some achievements were done until now:</p>

<p>The Promise example (Swift 2.1) is now almost compiling in latest Fire Beta / Sugar development tree. See <a href="http://talk.remobjects.com/t/fire-8-3-92-beta-error-e0-internal-error-an-item-with-the-same-key-has-already-been-added/7730/42">http://talk.remobjects.com/t/fire-8-3-92-beta-error-e0-internal-error-an-item-with-the-same-key-has-already-been-added/7730/42</a> for more details;
The Sugar project (development tree) now compiles in MacOS X ( see <a href="http://talk.remobjects.com/t/compile-sugar-sln-on-fire-macosx/7857/7">http://talk.remobjects.com/t/compile-sugar-sln-on-fire-macosx/7857/7</a> )
So far I was able to</p>

<p>Perform HTTP calls in both iOS and Android targets;
Create a Database through Sugar.Data iOS target;
The Promise runs only in Xcode/Swift 2.1. It will be able to run in Fire very soon (See previous note).
Todos:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database support in Android target through Sugar.Data (See issues below).</li>
</ul>

<p>Issues:</p>

<li>Currently I'm facing some issues on Sugar.Data / Android target:</li>
